# Stephen Anthony

This publication is named after my family's machine shop, whose stories of resilience still drive me today. When my great-grandfather immigrated to the USA from Italy, he started his shop, Loyal Machine, in 1929. For anyone who is not a history buff, that was the start of the Great Depression. His beginnings were humble after he reached New York City on July 4th, 1910 from a poverty stricken Sicily. But Loyal Machine went on to thrive and do business with some of the most notable companies in Boston like Polaroid and Teradyne. These stories my grandmother told me growing up are the kind that move my spirit and drive me to live to the fullest.

## Profession

Since graduating college, I have been pivoting from Mechanical Engineering to building a career in Software/AI Engineering. At this point, 3 years later, the path is becoming clearer. But since Computer Science isn't what I studied in my undergraduate, imposter syndrome arrived as an unwelcome guest. Through my graduate studies, I have grown comfortable with the unknown and learning on the fly. The best and smartest engineers I have aspired to be in the Mechanical and Software Engineering spaces haven't been the ones who know it all but are the most adaptable and able to continuously learn. My present confidence comes from my ability to quickly learn and adapt and not what I already know.

## Passion

In my spare time, I love to stay active and play music. Providing a care-taking role for my grandparents at a young age taught me that health can come and go and showed me just how precious it is. My time in the gym and with the local run club is always spent with this in mind. A family friend who has MS and works out vigorously summed it up best when she said "I move to keep moving".

My expression and practice in music has waxed and waned over the years but my love has always been there. In the past couple years, I have found love in learning guitar, choir performances, and singing karaoke. Part of this website is dedicated to any original music I come up with. These songs are in the works and will appear here when ready.
